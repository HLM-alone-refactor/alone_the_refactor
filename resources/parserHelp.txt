Your survival depends on the quality of your choices. What will you do next?

You can type actions, such as, "eat food", "drink water", or "go hunting".

Try something from the list below:

eat food           drink water        go fishing
build fire         go trapping        go foraging
build shelter      get firewood       get water

If you find your morale getting low, you can boost your morale by being successful in
your daily taskings, or by typing: "boost morale". If you selected any of the morale items
from the ship, you could play your harmonica, write in your journal, gaze admiringly at
your family photo, or simply get some rest.

You can type "help" if you would like to display this text again.
