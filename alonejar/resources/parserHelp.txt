Your survival depends on the quality of your choices. What will you do next?

You can type actions, such as, "eat food", "drink water", or "go hunting".

Try something from the list below:

**********************************************************
* eat food      drink water   go fishing  play harmonica *
* build fire    go trapping   go foraging get journal    *
* build shelter get firewood  get water   put journal    *
**********************************************************

If you find your morale getting low, you can boost your morale by being successful in your daily tasks, or by typing: "boost morale". If you selected any of the morale items from the ship, you could play your harmonica, write in your journal, gaze admiringly at your family photo, or simply get some rest.
